# Challenges-Logbook

In this repository I'm going to log my attempts in programming contests.

Accepted tasks that were delivered on time are going to be tagged with `_ac`. 
Accepted ones that were delivered outside the elapsed time of the contest are going to be tagged with `_ac_overdue`.
Wrong answered or runtime error are going to be tagged with `_wa` and `_re` respectively.

The code that will be logged is going to be the most successful code for each task that I've managed to take in the contest.
